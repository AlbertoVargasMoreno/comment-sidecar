- configure and setup (table creation script; where to put db credentials)
- write tests!
- pagination
- db:
    - index correctly used? use `explain`.
    - insert with different timezone? -> insert as unix timestamp not as string
    - use epoch timestamp or datetime with timezone for read and write
- deletion link: 
    - on post creation, generate a token. this is required to delete a post (passed via url). this way, nobody can easily clear the whole db just by increasing the id.
    - zus√§tzlich pw schutz. aber im local webstorage ablegen.
    - moreover, only trash comments (set to set trashed/deleted). don't really delete it from db. reduces effects of an attack.
